  <h2>So What is This all About?</h2>

  <p>To be perfectly frank, I'm just not certain anymore. I may very well be going off the deep end, but at the time, these experiences felt far too real to me when it was going on. I had completely forgotten about all of this until I was recently going through some old childhood belongings and uncovered my dream journals from back then. Based on what I recorded, I believe I may have been some kind of test subject for a secret government experimentation program involving infiltrating people's dreams for some purpose. What that purpose was, I still haven't figured out. It's possible they were attempting to program me as a sleeper agent. Or maybe their aim was to simply drive a person insane. Below I have taken some of the more interesting entries from my dream journal. Most of them are from when I was around 11 years old.</p>

  <p>To give you some context, when I was around 9 years old, I went through a real rough patch with terrible nightmares. It got so bad that I could hardly get any shut-eye and was driving the whole household up the wall with my crankiness. Eventually, my mom took me to this special clinic that was supposed to be able to help with that kind of sleep issue. Surprisingly, whatever they did over there actually seemed to work! Well, at least I thought it had worked at the time. A year or two later, I started having these bizarre recurring dreams. More accurately, I should say I kept encountering this same mysterious man in my dreams night after night. This haunting cycle cursed me for the next five to seven years. I believe that this man was a part of a secret government program, and that it has something to do with the place I went to when I was 9. I can’t for the life of me remember what the name of the clinic was, but it has since closed down. </p>

  <p>Well, hopefully I have not come off as being too big of a nut. I don’t expect you to believe everything, but I really just want to put my story out there with the hopes that someone else might know something, or that maybe I will find others that experienced the same things. Anyway, Thank you for checking out my little corner of the web, and I hope you enjoy your time here!</p>

  <h2>Dream Log January 13, 1975</h2>

  <p>Last night, it happened again. The man in the suit appeared, just like he always does. This time, we were in a stark white room with no windows or doors. He stood there silently for a moment, studying me with an intense gaze that made my skin crawl.</p>

  <p>Then, as if reading from a script, he asked: "What lies beyond the veil of perception?" His voice was flat and emotionless. I tried to respond, but found myself unable to speak, as if my voice had been stolen from me.</p>

  <p>The man waited patiently for an answer that would never come. After what felt like an eternity, he shook his head in disappointment and simply vanished, leaving me alone in that blank void until I jolted awake in a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>These dreams are becoming more frequent and disturbing with each passing week. I'm starting to dread going to sleep at night, knowing that he'll be there waiting for me.</p>

  <h2>Dream Log April 14, 1975</h2>

  <p>I really thought I might have seen the last of the man in the suit, at least for a while. It had been five peaceful nights since he last intruded on my dreams, and I was starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I'd gotten a reprieve. No such luck, as it turns out.</p>

  <p>Last night's dream started off in a completely different setting than usual. Instead of the sterile white room I've come to expect, the suit and I were standing in the middle of a dark, dense forest. The only light source was the full moon overhead, which cast long, eerie shadows across everything.</p>

  <p>True to form, he had another bizarre question for me right off the bat: "What is the nature of consciousness?" And just like every other time, I couldn't force a single word out in response. I just stood there like a deer in the headlights as he slowly circled around me.</p>

  <p>But here's where things took an even more disturbing turn. As he moved, I noticed he was holding something in his hand - a syringe, filled with some kind of dark liquid. That's when the icy tendrils of fear really started to grip me.</p>
  
  <p>He came up close behind me and whispered right in my ear, "You will know the answer soon enough. And when you do, everything will change."</p>
  
  <p>I woke up screaming, my sheets drenched in sweat. The terror of the dream lingered long after I opened my eyes, a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake. What did he mean by "soon enough"? And what is going to change?</p>

<h2>Dream Log Jun 12, 1975</h2>

  <p>Another restless night kept me awake, though this time it felt rather odd. If you haven't figured it out, I saw that strange man again. I was sitting on the living room couch watching cartoons when he appeared out of nowhere. He came over and sat right beside me, giving off an oddly fatherly aura and offering up lessons about life and being happy. He told me that one day I'm going to make a real difference in this world, and that I shouldn't question what he says. Strange?</p>

<h2>Dream Log Jun 19, 1975</h2>

  <p>I'm just not sure what he wants from me? This latest time, I was sitting in my math class waiting for the teacher to arrive. Out of nowhere, that peculiar man showed up and announced he'd be taking over the class instead. Strangely, all my classmates didn't bat an eye and just stared ahead blankly. He then locked eyes with me and started firing off these really odd questions like "Why are you this way?" and "What's holding you back from your full potential?" I started feeling incredibly uneasy when I noticed the whole class was now gawking at me, repeating everything that man said in perfect unison. It became too overwhelming. I had to get out of there and bolted for the door as fast as I could. That's when I woke up from the dream. I just want this to end. </p>

<h2>Dream Log September 24, 1975</h2>

  <p>Why, oh why does this keep happening to me? I just want to live a regular, normal kind of life. I was hoping my mom taking me back to that clinic would help straighten things out, but after last night's episode, that seems doubtful. The man showed up again like usual, but this time his behavior was totally different - he was fuming mad. I've never seen him in such an angry state before. He kept ranting about how I was messing everything up, and that I need to quit overthinking things and just listen to what he tells me. I don't understand what he wants from me at all. I just want it to stop. </p>
  
  <h2>Dream Log December 11, 1975</h2>

  <p>I've lost count of how many times I've encountered that man in my dreams now. It has to be at least a hundred occurrences by this point. This latest time, I found myself alone in a pitch-black room. I couldn't see a thing, but I could hear his voice clear as day. He started asking me to repeat peculiar phrases back to him verbatim. I'm already forgetting exactly what they were, but it was nonsensical stuff like "one apple, blue shovel, two ducks, red hat?" None of it made a lick of sense to me. Whenever I tried to ask what it all meant, he'd just repeat the bizarre phrases louder without any explanation. </p>
  
  <h2>Dream Log January 2, 1976</h2>

  <p>I ran this time. As soon as I realized what was going on, I took off sprinting. I didn't want to hear what the man had to say, I just wanted him to be gone. Sadly, this did not work and he hovered next to me the whole time. Continuing to tell me that nothing was going to change and that I was only prolonging the problem. I kept asking what he wanted from me, but he would never give me a straightforward answer. Luckily or not, I ended up running into a wall and woke myself up. </p>
  
  <h2>Dream Log January 30, 1976</h2>

  <p>It was really weird tonight, you know? The man showed up like usual, asking all his goofy random questions. But something seemed kinda off this time. It was almost like he was having a conversation with someone else too? I didn't know what to make of it at first. Part of me wanted to butt in, but another part was curious to hear what he was yakking about. From what I could gather, it sounded like he was arguing with this other person about the best way to keep moving forward? He kept insisting he had everything under control and didn't need their input. Eventually though, he must have noticed me eavesdropping because he abruptly stopped and went back to spouting his normal nonsense gibberish directly at me. Such a bizarre scene, I'm telling you! Made my head spin trying to figure it out. </p>
